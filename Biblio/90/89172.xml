    <note resp="#BP">For nearly three decades Professor C. Wilfred Griggs, with Brigham Young University as the sponsoring institution, has excavated at a necropolis located on the eastern edge of the Fayum depression. The site includes two large Graeco-Roman cemeteries. The project, to date, has resulted in the discovery of over seventeen hundred burials. The information gleaned from these burials provides a unique opportunity to study the symbolic significance of artifacts within the historical and cultural context of native Egyptian and Graeco-Roman populations and their exposure to the early influences of Christianity. Provide an overview of the project and highlight a small intricately woven pomegranate textile discovered in 1987 (4th to 5th centuries AD). - Fag el-Gamous Necropolis. - Demographic and Religious Influences in the Fayum. - Discoveries. - Iconography / Pomegranate Textile. - History of the Pomegranate. - Conclusion. - Avec résumé en anglais.</note>
