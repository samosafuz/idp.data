   <seg type="original" subtype="resume" resp="#BP">In the so-called epikrisis documents, soldiers sometimes also presented their citizenship diplomas. From these, an extract in Greek was occasionally included in the administrative records. These have not been considered as fully valid documentation in the collections of military diplomas until now. Therefore, the partially preserved diplomas were not included in the collections. Such cases are retranslated into the original Latin form. - [P. Clermont-Ganneau 1b =] S.B. VI, 9228. - P. Hamb.
