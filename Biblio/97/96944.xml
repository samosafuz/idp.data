   <seg type="original" subtype="resume" resp="#BP">Contains the edition and study of three ostraca in the British Library (Ostracon 5878) which join with another fragment in the Metropolitan Museum, New York (P. Mon. Epiph. 607). The join of these pieces helps to date the British Library fragments to the turn of the 6th-7th centuries and assign them to Apa Moses from the Monastery of Epiphanius in Thebes. The ostracon now provides a complete and unique text of the Great Doxology as used in the Coptic Church of the late 6th century and probably the earliest version of the so-called Constantinopolitan version of this liturgical chant.</seg>
