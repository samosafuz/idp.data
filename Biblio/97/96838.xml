   <seg type="original" subtype="resume" resp="#BP">The papyrological edition has not stopped evolving since the publication of the first papyrus in the 18th century. And, despite the fixing of editorial norms with the Leiden system (1931), it continues to change. It improves at the same time as it adapts to the ever-changing requirements of the historical and philological sciences but also of the academic context. In this sense, it is a reflection of science and its organization. It is therefore not illegitimate to wonder whether certain developments are beneficial and whether certain adjustments would not be profitable.</seg>
