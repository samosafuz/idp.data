XIII, 659, published in 1977, which concerns a dispute settled by means of mesiteia (i.e. mediation / arbitration). A plausible reconstruction of events is provided, which allows insight into the numerous correlations between the institutions as well as regulations known from the law on the one hand, and the legal practice as demonstrated by the papyri on the other.</seg>
