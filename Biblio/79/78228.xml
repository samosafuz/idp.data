    <note resp="#BP">Limestone relief with Greek inscription [S.E.G. XXXIII, 1546]. Proposes that the person who engraved a phrase from Anth. Pal. V, 152 on a (pre-existing?) stone relief may have viewed the object, not as a representation of Meleager's epigram, but as a depiction of the type of demonic visitation that Meleager playfully alludes to sending a mosquito as a "swift messenger" to summon the woman he desires.</note>
